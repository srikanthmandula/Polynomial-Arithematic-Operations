# Polynomial-Arithematic-Operations
 Program to implement polynomial multiplication.  Specifically, Program will read each polynomial’s degree and coefficients which are separated in different lines from a file named “input.txt” and then it creates a file named “output.txt” by writing the coefficients of polynomials resulted by adding, subtracting and multiplying the given two polynomials to“output.txt”.  In “input.txt”:  1. First line is the degree of first polynomial  2. Second line is the coefficients of first polynomial separated by blank space.  3. Third line is the degree of second polynomial 4. Fourth line is the coefficients of first polynomial separated by blank space.  In “output.txt”:  1. First line is the coefficients of polynomial resulted by addition of given two polynomials. 2. Second line is the coefficients of polynomial resulted by subtraction of given two polynomials. 3. Third line is the coefficients of polynomial resulted by multiplication of given two polynomials.
